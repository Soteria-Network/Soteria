# What is Soteria?

Soteria Network based on RVN/BTC Core designed for efficient and interoperable asset management. 
Taking development cues from Ravencoin and latest versions of Bitcoin, Soteria Network currently
employs a completely new variant of dynamic and timestamped energy friendly hashing algorithms, 
SoterG for GPU and SoterC for CPU. The assets in Soteria can be automated using Soteria Smart Plans
allowing the creation of decentralized applications using Lua VM.
The network prioritizes usability, automation, and low fees to make asset minting and management
simple, affordable, and secure. The network's economy runs on SOTER, our native coin that can be
mined on a dual algorithm setup using either GPUs or CPUs.

#### Version strategy
Version numbers are following ```major.minor.patch``` semantics.

Soteria is open source and community driven. The development process is publicly visible and anyone can contribute.

### Branches

There are **3** types of branches:

- **master:** *Stable*, contains the code of the latest version of the latest *major.minor* release.
- **maintenance:** Stable, contains the latest version of previous releases,
  which are still under active maintenance. Format: ```<version>-maint```
- **development:** Unstable, contains the latest code under development and the new code for
 upcoming releases. Format: ```<version>-dev```

***Submit your pull requests against `master`***

*Maintenance branches are exclusively mutable by release. When a release is*
*planned, a development branch will be created and commits from master will*
*be cherry-picked into these by maintainers.*
